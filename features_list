Improvements to make in general
- password hashing (cryptographically secure one-way hash), salting, peppering
  - bcrypt would be a good option
- logging is pretty essential even for dev
- reduce number of sql queries? e.g. db.create_user() then new_user = db.get_user(username)... either return success from first
	db query or return data
- create helper functions to get rid of repeated logic/validation
- email validation: https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/

Improvements to make if moving to prod:
- Use production webserver like nginx
- Use production sql db such as postgres
  - sqlite only has 1 writer at a time, so not good for multiple users
  - sqlite can handle large data, but not always practical
